## 📖 What is a Pokédex?

> **Comprehensive Pokemon Database Dashboard** featuring all 1,025 Pokemon (Generations I-IX) with interactive visualizations, competitive data, and game availability tracking.

A **Pokédex** is a digital electronic encyclopedia that acts as a guide for Pokémon trainers, recording data on Pokémon species they encounter. In the games, it tracks the player's progress in catching or observing Pokémon, with detailed entries unlocked as a trainer catches or obtains a species. It's an essential tool for any trainer, and in some versions of the games and the anime, it functions as a reference tool to learn about Pokémon types, sizes, and locations.

🌐 **Live Application:** [https://1pokemon.streamlit.app/](https://1pokemon.streamlit.app/)

This dashboard serves as your **digital Pokédex companion**, providing comprehensive data analysis and exploration tools for the complete National Pokédex spanning Generations 1 through 9.
